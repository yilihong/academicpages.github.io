I am an Associate Professor, Co-Director of the [Digital Society Initiative](https://research.wpcarey.asu.edu/digital-society/) and the Director of the PhD Program in the [Department of Information Systems](https://wpcarey.asu.edu/people/profile/2355839) at the W. P. Carey School of Business of Arizona State University. I obtained my Ph.D. in Management Information Systems at the Fox School of Business, Temple University, under the mentorship and advising of Prof. [Paul A. Pavlou](https://www.bauer.uh.edu/administration/office-of-dean/paul-pavlou.php). I am currently a Senior Editor of [*Production and Operations Management*](http://www.poms.org/journal/departments/), and an Associate Editor at [*Information Systems Research*](https://pubsonline.informs.org/page/isre/editorial-board) and the [*Journal of the Association for Information Systems*](https://aisel.aisnet.org/jais/editorialboard.html).

My research interests are in the areas of *Future of Work*, *Digital Platforms*, *User-generated Content*, and *Human-AI Interactions*. My research has been published in premier journals such as *Management Science*, *Information Systems Research*, *MIS Quarterly*, *Journal of Management Information Systems*, *Journal of the Association for Information Systems*, and *Journal of Consumer Psychology*. My work has been supported by multiple prestigious grants, from the *NET Institute* (2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018), the *Department of Education* (2011, 2013, 2015), *Robert Wood Johnson Foundation* (2017-2019), and the *National Science Foundation* (2018-2020).

My dissertation research on the gig economy and future of work was awarded the *ACM SIGMIS Best Dissertation Award* (2014) and runner-up *INFORMS ISS Nunamaker-Chen Dissertation Award* (2014). In 2017, I was awarded the college-wide *W. P. Carey Faculty Research Award*.

And recently, I was awarded the *Associate Editor of the Year Award* (2018) from *Information Systems Research*. According to the [AIS Research Rankings](https://www.aisresearchrankings.org/rankings/), I was ranked #3 in the world based on publications in the top four information systems journals (*MISQ*, *ISR*, *JMIS*, *JAIS*) and #7 based on the top two information systems journals (*MISQ*, *ISR*) in 2016-2018.

At W. P. Carey School of Business, I have taught and led the curriculum development at both the undergraduate ([CIS](/files/CIS360_Hong.pdf) and [BDA](/files/CIS315_Hong.docx)) and graduate ([MS-BA](/files/MSBA_Applied_Projects_Syllabus.docx) and [PhD](/files/CIS791_Hong.doc)) levels. Most notably, I led the college-level initiatives in designing and implementing the undergraduate analytics core course -- [Problem Solving and Actionable Analytics](/files/WPC300_Syllabus_2020Spring_V04.docx) (WPC300). And most recently, I serve as the course coordinator for WPC300, overseeing over 40 sections of the course each year taught by instructors from multiple departments. Further, I led a team of analytics faculty in designing, implementing, and coordinating the core college analytics course in the [online](/files/Hong-WPC300-Spring A_Online_Syllabus.docx) and [hybrid](/files/WPC300_Schedule_2020Spring.docx) (onsite + online) formats. Here is a [live stream recording](https://player.theplatform.com/p/U8-EDC/dKzF6F2_w14a/select/media/dCsGzS1z_uCq?form=html) of my talk on analytics teaching and research in the W. P. Carey 'Back-to-Class' Alumni event in April 2019. I received Department of Information Systems' Outstanding Teaching Award in 2016, and was a finalist for the W. P. Carey Huizingh Undergraduate Teaching Award and ASU Outstanding Doctoral Mentor in 2019.

Prior to my academic career, I have worked at [China International Capital Corporation](https://en.cicc.com/), a leading investment bank in China. Besides research and teaching as a faculty member, I serve as an advisor or external research scientist for a number of companies, including [Lyft](https://www.lyft.com/), [Freelancer](https://www.freelancer.com/), [Magene](http://www.magene.cn/), [fits.me](https://fits.me/), [Summer](https://imsummer.cn/), [Meishijie](http://www.meishij.net/), [Ports America](https://www.portsamerica.com/), and [Picmonic](https://www.picmonic.com/).

In my spare time, I enjoy reading books and writing codes. I am an avid [*Emacs*](https://www.spacemacs.org/) user, a [*typography*](https://fontsinuse.com/) enthusiast, a dedicated [*Redditor*](https://www.reddit.com/), and a famed [*mechanical keyboard*](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/) designer and collector.
