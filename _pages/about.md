I am a Full Professor of Decision and Information Sciences, Director of the Bauer College PhD Programs, and a Bauer Senior Fellow in the [C. T. Bauer College of Business](https://www.bauer.uh.edu/search/directory/profile.asp?firstname=Kevin&lastname=Hong) at University of Houston. I am also a faculty advisory member of the [HPE Data Science Institute](https://hpedsi.uh.edu/). I currently serve as a Senior Editor of [*Production and Operations Management*](http://www.poms.org/journal/departments/), and an Associate Editor at [*Information Systems Research*](https://pubsonline.informs.org/page/isre/editorial-board) and the [*Journal of the Association for Information Systems*](https://aisel.aisnet.org/jais/editorialboard.html).

My research interests are in the areas of *Future of Work*, *Digital Platforms*, *User-generated Content*, and *Human-AI Interactions*. My research has been published in premier journals such as *Management Science*, *Information Systems Research*, *MIS Quarterly*, *Production and Operations Management*, *Journal of Management Information Systems*, *Journal of the Association for Information Systems*, and *Journal of Consumer Psychology*. My work has been supported by multiple prestigious grants, from the *NET Institute* (2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2020), the *Department of Education* (2011, 2013, 2015), *Robert Wood Johnson Foundation* (2017-2019), and the *National Science Foundation* (2018-2020).

My research papers have won a number of best paper awards at major conferences, including the *Workshop on Information Systems and Economics* (2018), the *International Conference on Information Systems* (2012, 2018, 2020), *Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences* (2017), *America's Conference on Information Systems* (2012), and the *China Summer Workshop on Information Management* (2018). My dissertation research on the gig economy and future of work was awarded the *ACM SIGMIS Best Dissertation Award* (2014) and runner-up *INFORMS ISS Nunamaker-Chen Dissertation Award* (2014). In 2017, I was awarded the college-wide *W. P. Carey Faculty Research Award*. Further, I was awarded the *Association for Information Systems Early Career Award* (2018) and the *INFORMS Information Systems Society Sandy Slaughter Early Career Award* (2019). And recently, I was awarded the *Associate Editor of the Year Award* (2018) from *Information Systems Research*. According to the [AIS Research Rankings](https://www.aisresearchrankings.org/rankings/), I was ranked #3 in the world based on publications in the top four information systems journals (*MISQ*, *ISR*, *JMIS*, *JAIS*) and #7 based on the top two information systems journals (*MISQ*, *ISR*) in 2016-2018. And most recently, I received the Outstanding PhD Alumni Award (2020) from the Fox School of Business, Temple University.

Prior to joining the Bauer College at UH, I worked at the W. P. Carey School of Business at Arisona State University (ASU) as an Assistant Professor (2014-2018) and tenured Associate Professor (2018-2020), where I was also the director of the PhD program, co-director of the Digital Society Initiative, and the Nita & Phil Francis Faculty Fellow. I have taught and led the curriculum development at both the undergraduate ([CIS](/files/CIS360_Hong.pdf) and [BDA](/files/CIS315_Hong.docx)) and graduate ([MS-BA](/files/MSBA_Applied_Projects_Syllabus.docx) and [PhD](/files/CIS791_Hong.doc)) levels. Most notably, I led the college-level initiatives in designing and implementing the undergraduate analytics core course -- [Problem Solving and Actionable Analytics](/files/WPC300_Syllabus_2020Spring_V04.docx) (WPC300). Serving as the course coordinator for WPC300, I oversaw over 50 sections of the course each year taught by instructors from multiple departments. Further, I led a team of analytics faculty in designing, implementing, and coordinating the core college analytics course in the [online](/files/Hong-WPC300-Spring A_Online_Syllabus.docx) and [hybrid](/files/WPC300_Schedule_2020Spring.docx) (onsite + online) formats. Here is a [live stream recording](https://player.theplatform.com/p/U8-EDC/dKzF6F2_w14a/select/media/dCsGzS1z_uCq?form=html) of my talk on analytics teaching and research in the W. P. Carey 'Back-to-Class' Alumni event in April 2019. I received Department of Information Systems' Outstanding Teaching Award in 2016, and was a finalist for the W. P. Carey Huizingh Undergraduate Teaching Award (2019), Huizingh Award for Undergraduate Service to Students (2020), and the ASU Outstanding Doctoral Mentor (2020).

Prior to my academic career, I have worked as an analyst at a leading investment bank and as a language specialist for the International Olympics Committee. Besides research and teaching as a faculty member, I serve as an advisor or external research scientist for a number of tech companies, primarily working with them on large-scale digital field experimentation efforts. Some of my corporate research partners include Alibaba, Lyft, Freelancer, Magene, fits.me, Summer, Meishijie, Ports America, Extole, Ookong, and Picmonic.

In my spare time, I enjoy reading books and writing codes. I am an avid [*Emacs*](https://www.spacemacs.org/) user, a [*typography*](https://fontsinuse.com/) enthusiast, a dedicated [*Redditor*](https://www.reddit.com/), and a famed [*mechanical keyboard*](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/) designer and collector.
